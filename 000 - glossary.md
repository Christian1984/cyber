## enumeration

Enumeration is the process of obtaining information from a system, such as user identities, machine names, network resources, shares, and services.

Enumeration is also called as Information Gathering Phase which is the first phase where hackers try to gather information and try to establish an active connection with the devices or systems. Attackers often evaluate attack vectors by using the output of the enumeration to exploit the system further.

To collect usernames, hostnames, IP addresses, passwords, configurations, and other information, enumeration is used.

## foothold

The attacker ensures he maintains continued control over a recently compromised system. This occurs immediately following the initial compromise. Typically, the attacker establishes a foothold by installing a persistent backdoor or downloading additional utilities or malware to the victim system.

After exploiting a target system and gaining access, the next step is to establish a foothold by using a remote-access tool. A remote-access tool is a critical component of any penetration test, as it allows you to execute commands remotely on a system as well as maintain access to the system over time.
